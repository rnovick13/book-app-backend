This is the backend to what will become a much bigger site. This application currently lets users add and delete reviews for the listed books. Eventually, the app will let users track the books they've read, put them in lists, and mark their favorites.

The data used in this application is from seed data but will soon link to external APIs with more content.

Frontend found at https://github.com/rnovick13/book-app-frontend

To run application, run
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

Then start the front end.
